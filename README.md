Exact diagonalization code for one-dimensional systems with symmetries: conserved particle number (N), momentum (k), real-space reflection (p), and spin inversion (z).

This code requires Intel MKL. The construction of a symmetric basis is based on Sandvik's book (A. W. Sandvik, Computational studies of quantum spin systems, AIP Conference Proceedings 1297, 135 (2010)).

The code is currently in dense form and aims to solve many-body localization-related problems. It produces data for the following paper:

[1] Many-body localization in clean chains with long-range interactions, Chen Cheng, Phys. Rev. B 108, 155113 (2023)
